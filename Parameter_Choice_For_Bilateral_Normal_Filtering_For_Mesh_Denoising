Bilateral Normal Filtering for Mesh Denoising

σ_s typically lies in the range of [0.2-0.6], with higher values for higher level of noise.

Scheme I -> local, iterative scheme
Scheme II -> global, non-iterative scheme

Scheme I  (normal updating iterations, σ_s, vertex updating iterations, neighborhood size)
Scheme II (λ, σ_s, vertex updating iterations, neighborhood size)

The first type, denoted by NI(i), is a set of faces that share edges with fi
The second type, denoted by NII(i), is a set of faces that share common vertices with fi.

We found that the first type of face neighborhood NI works well for non-CAD models and NII is more suitable for CAD-like models.

-> Conclusion: Usar Face Neighbor: edges quando filtrando non-CAD, usar Face Neighbor: vertices quando filtrando CAD.

(Eles usam NII em todos testes deles no artigo)

λ -> smoothness

Among the parameters, the number of normal updating iterations for our local, iterative scheme, λ for our global, non-iterative scheme, and σ_s for both schemes influence the degree of denoising the most significantly. Figure 6 shows that larger values of σ_s or λ lead to smoother results.

Scheme 1 -> variar σ_s e normal updating iterations para aumentar/diminuir denoising
Scheme 2 -> variar σ_s e λ para aumentar/diminuir denoising
